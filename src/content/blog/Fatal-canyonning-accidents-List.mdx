title: Fatal canyonning accidents List
---

The reason behind this dark list is two-fold. Firstly, I want to honor and remember those who shared our passion and to preserve their names for as long as I live. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I want to show that this is an extreme sport that demands preparation and respect for the streams.

If you wish to include some event, please send me an email to [canyoning@juanmontesinos.com ](mailto:canyoning@juanmontesinos.com)copy paste this template and just replace:

When: 09/05/2024\

## Drowned

Miguel Ángel Hernández Andrés, a 35-year-old spanish firefighter passed drowned in a sensible rappel.

**When**: 30/04/2024\
**Possible reason**: High (yet not impossible) flow. Alone.\
**Personal hypotesis**: 90-meter rappel split into 2x45m with a water pool in between. With high flow, the waterfall can push you into the rock. There is a rock in the water pool where ropes can get entangled to.\
